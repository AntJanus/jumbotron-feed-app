Jumbotron Feed
==============
View the [demo](http://jumbotron-app.antjan.us).

To use: setup [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku) with the bower/grunt plugins and deploy!

Uses [Popstar CMS](http://popstar.antjan.us/) for its backend and [VueJS](http://vuejs.org/) for its front-end

###Branches
I decided to keep master at the bleeding edge. Check out the branch listings to see what other implementations have been done. Currently, there should only be the VueJS implementation.
